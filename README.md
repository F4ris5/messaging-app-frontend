# This is a Messaging App

This project only works between admin and users (so far). Made using react for the frontend, this frontend is currently hosted on gitpages. The project also involves a backend and a database, namely express and posgresql respectively.

## Running Locally

If you want to run this locally, proceed to download the main code. Then, extract and open the code using your editor app. Use `npm start` to run it in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and view in your browser. Keep in mind that this project is dependent on another backend code that I have also uploaded on github. Some of the functions of this project will not work without it (ex. registering, logging in) Link: [https://github.com/F4ris5/messaging-app-backend](https://github.com/F4ris5/messaging-app-backend)
